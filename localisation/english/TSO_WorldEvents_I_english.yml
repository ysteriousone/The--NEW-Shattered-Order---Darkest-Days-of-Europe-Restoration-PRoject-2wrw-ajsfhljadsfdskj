 WORLD.TSO.1.t: "[Get_newspaper_header]Yugoslavia Re-established"
 WORLD.TSO.1.d: "Many did not expect this turn of affairs from Italy. It was expected that they would be mercilessly crushed, subjected and brought to heel. However, the entire World was proven wrong as earlier this morning, The Italian Government has announced a complete retreat from Croatia as a whole and surrendered most of old Yugoslav lands to the Partisans under Tito. This spells an ominious future for the Fascist Party as their legitimacy has now been brought into question. In liberated Zagreb however, rows upon rows of celibrating slavs could be seen, holding a portrait of the SFR Yugoslavia flag and their Marshal, Josip Broz Tito, chanting 'Uz Marsala Tita'."
 WORLD.TSO.1.a: "Wait... They lost to a bunch of farmers?"
